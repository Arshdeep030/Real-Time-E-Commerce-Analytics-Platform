## 1️⃣ Streaming (Real-Time Processing)

- Imagine a live e-commerce website:
- Users are browsing, adding to cart, and buying things.
- Every time they do something, an event is sent (like “user clicked product X”).
- The streaming part watches these events as they happen, in real time.
- It groups user actions into sessions — e.g., all actions by a user in a 30-minute window.
- It counts how many actions each user does in that session.
- You can see the results immediately — like a live dashboard of current user activity.

So basically, streaming is like tracking users live as they interact with your site.

## 2️⃣ Batch (Historical / Daily Analytics)

Now think about the end of the day:

- You want reports: how many purchases were made today, how much revenue you earned, etc.
- The batch job looks at all the stored data collected over the day (or longer).
- It filters out only the relevant events (like purchases).
- It adds up totals — total money, number of purchases per day.
- The results are used for business insights, dashboards, and reports.

So batch is like looking back at all activity to summarize the day.
